# Nodejs-boilerplate
Boilerplate Project for building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express and MySql

<b>Multilayer folder structure</b>

Use of Best Practices of Node js and Clean Architecture focused on codebase scalability.

<b>Scalable and easy to use web server</b>
Use Express for requests routing and middlewares. There are some essential middlewares for web APIs already setup, like body-parser, CORS and method-override.

<b>Database integration</b>

Sequelize, an ORM for SQL databases, is already integrated, you just have to set the authentication configurations.

<b>CLI integration</b>

Both the application and Sequelize have command-line tools to make it easy to work with them. Check the Scripts section to know more about this feature.
